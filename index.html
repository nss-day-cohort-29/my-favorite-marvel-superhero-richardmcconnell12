    <p>Spider-Man is my favorite Marvel Superhero, because he's showed me that "with great power, comes great responsibility". He wasn't born with his powers, he was gifted his powers. That allowed him to have complete control of what he could use them for. He stood for what was right, and even though situations seemed out of his control, he never let them get the best of him. Peter Parker was a normal boy, but his powers didn't change his demeaner. He knew his responsibities, and knew how to handle them with class. The way he kept his identity was creative, and hidden in plain sight.</p>
